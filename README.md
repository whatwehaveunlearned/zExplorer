Zexplorer

The Zexplorer project comprises of three repositories:

Two are mantained by me:

[SageBrain](https://github.com/whatwehaveunlearned/zExplorer_SageBrain): Python Server to manage data.
[zotAngular](https://github.com/whatwehaveunlearned/zExplorer_ZotAngular): Frontend interface in angular.

Another is an external repository:

[Bert_as_a_service](https://github.com/hanxiao/bert-as-service)
